Hi Youssef and Tasneem,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on our ongoing project. Please find attached two files: one containing important security information and the other containing the project report.

For added security, we have implemented an advanced encryption system for our communications. The security information in Attachment 1 is encrypted using AES, and the email content is digitally signed using RSA. This ensures that the information reaches you securely and has not been tampered with.

To decrypt Attachment 1, you'll need the corresponding decryption key, which will be shared with you separately for enhanced security.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
Mostafa Nasrat
